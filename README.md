# EOG
senior design project notes last updated 6.2.21
main modules found inside eogCore.py for oragnization.
this project branches into a voltage differential approach and a fourier analysis approach. 
fourierCore.py stores methods related to fourier domain analysis
sshCore.py stores methods related to ssh protocols for communicating between raspberry pis.
utilitiesCore.py stores related methods to visualization solutions, plotting and related helper functions.
pay careful attention not to mix these methods. Will subdivide these in the near future.


look at "GettingStarted.txt" for initializing the raspberry pi.
